These collection classes store a collection of the definition objects that are needed. They convert from the "raw" '
definitions of models found in {ranks, seasons, maps}.py and make it available as a collection of `model` objects in
the class's constructor.

If we use an alternative data store in the future it may be worth refactoring out this logic.
